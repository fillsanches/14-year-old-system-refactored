# 14-year-old-system-refactored
A public project to collaboratively refactor a PHP system built in 2011 using PHP.

I'm still defining the next steps for the project.

You can start by learning about the history behind the project on the [Wiki](https://github.com/fillsanches/14-year-old-system-refactored/wiki) pages.
